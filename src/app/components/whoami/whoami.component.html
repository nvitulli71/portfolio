          I am an Full Stack Developer with nearly 10 years of professional experience and have a passion for continuous
          learning and improvement. I've played various roles from individual contributor, team lead, and even project
          manager. I take pride in my work and the product that gets put out. I strive to provide the client/end-user
          exactly what they need to solve their problems. In my spare time I work to keep up to date with the latest
          frameworks and software development trends.
